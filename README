The Location Based Event Tracker is a mobile service to help users learn what’s happening in their vicinity.  With our application, users can find local events, see whats other people in the area are doing, and keep track of all the places they have visited. Unlike other event trackers, LBET is community based, so users find out about events from other people around them.  

Using the service is simple. The users’ mobile continuously pings our system with their current location to find out what is going on in their current city.  Our system then checks for other users in the vicinity to see if they are concentrated around specific locations. If so, LBET queries a subset of users regarding what event is going on, and returns the information to other users. The users now knows what the community is up to, and won't miss another event again. A web based system would also allow seeing what’s going on around the world.

LBET also finds out general information about the user's location. Thus, the user can benefit both from the historical data and community suggestions to make sure they explore every aspect of the city.

= Building =

The easiest way to build and run the system is to import the two projects, GeoServer and EventTrackerWebApp, to Eclipse.  GeoServer is the main back end component.  In order to bootstrap the system with 8 geo servers (4 slave/4 master) and 2 locator servers, we provided a small application in /GeoServer/tests/edu/cmu/eventtracker/tests/Bootstrap.java which takes care of that.  After that, one could deploy the Web App (EventTrackerWebApp) to the tomcat and play with the system.

GeoServer also includes ant build file but it was generated by Eclipse and was not tested for correctness in different environment without eclipse and etc...
